# nba-draft-recommendation

## The purpose of this project is to match NBA draft prospects to NBA teams based on factors like NBA teams' depth at certain positions and most pressing needs (i.e. shooting, rebounding, etc.) based on percentile in the league. The list of prospects is scraped from the NBA's website (https://www.nba.com/draft/2020/prospects#/), and prospect stats will be scraped from sports-reference (NCAA) and basketball-reference (international).
